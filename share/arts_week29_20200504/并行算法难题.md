* Monte Carlo analysis[9]
* Distributed relational database queries using distributed set processing.
* Numerical integration[10]
* Serving static files on a webserver to multiple users at once.[citation needed]
* The Mandelbrot set, Perlin noise and similar images, where each point is calculated independently.
* Rendering of computer graphics. In computer animation, each frame or pixel may be rendered independently (see parallel rendering).
* Brute-force searches in cryptography.[11] Notable real-world examples include distributed.net and proof-of-work systems used in cryptocurrency.
* BLAST searches in bioinformatics for multiple queries (but not for individual large queries).[12]
* Large scale facial recognition systems that compare thousands of arbitrary acquired faces (e.g., a security or surveillance video via closed-circuit television) with similarly large number of previously stored faces (e.g., a rogues gallery or similar watch list).[13]
* Computer simulations comparing many independent scenarios.
* Genetic algorithms.[14]
* Ensemble calculations of numerical weather prediction.
* Event simulation and reconstruction in particle physics.
* The marching squares algorithm.
* Sieving step of the quadratic sieve and the number field sieve.
* Tree growth step of the random forest machine learning technique.
* Discrete Fourier transform where each harmonic is independently calculated.
* Convolutional neural networks running on GPUs.
* Hyperparameter grid search in machine learning.[citation needed]
* Parallel search in constraint programming[15]
